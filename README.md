# Shopify AI Raycast Extension

A Raycast extension that allows you to query Shopify AI models directly from your desktop.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server and install the extension
4. Once installed, you can stop the development server (Ctrl+C) - the extension will continue working
5. The extension will appear in your Raycast command palette as "Ask Shopify AI"

Note: The development server is only needed for installing the extension and watching for file changes during development. The extension itself runs independently once installed.
